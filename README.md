# R-and-D

## This is Radu and Danny's Playground

The project is an implementation of a basic Web Application. It describes how to build and run a simple trivia web application using the Python Flask framework on your computer. It calls the https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/trivia REST API to generate random questions and answers. 


## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Any web browser

### Steps

1. **Open the terminal on Mac/Linux**

    Open your terminal application. You can usually find this in your Applications folder or by searching for it.

2. **Run the following command**

    Navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located. Then, run the command:

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

3. **Open any web browser**

    After running the above command, open any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and type the following URL into the address bar:

    ```
    127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

    This will open the web application.
